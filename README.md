# Three-Month-Sales-Analysis-for-Everything-and-More-Supermarket
This project gave an in-dept understanding of the sales progress of everything and more supermarket at 3 branches for 3 months, customers preferences and purchase behavior. The growth of supermarkets in populated cities has been increasing, with market competition also rising. This project applied predictive data analytics methods to a dataset, offering an in-depth understanding of sales progress, customer preferences, and purchasing behavior at three supermarket branches over a period of three months.

Data Overview
The analysis focused on the following columns:

Branch: The branch of the supermarket (three branches are available, identified as A, B, and C).

City: The location of the supermarkets.

Gender: The gender of the customer.

Product Line: General categorization of items sold (e.g., Electronic Accessories, Fashion Accessories, Food and Beverages, Health and Beauty, Home and Lifestyle, Sports and Travel).

Quantity: The number of products purchased by each customer.

Date: The date of purchase (data recorded from January 2019 to March 2019).

Payment: The payment method used by the customer (Cash, Credit Card, or E-Wallet).

Gross Income: Total Price of the customerâ€™s purchase minus the Cost of Goods.

Project Objectives:

1. To identify the total sales generated by different product lines.
2. To examine the sales trends over the three months of data collection.
3. To analyze the sales generated at each of the three branches.
4. To ensure that sales data for the three cities aligns with sales at the corresponding branches.
5. To evaluate the progress of gross income for each branch.
6. To analyze customer purchasing behavior by product line and gender.
7. To assess the frequency of product purchases across branches and gender.
   
Data Cleaning Process:

I reviewed each column for spelling errors, duplicates, missing rows, and improperly formatted values. The dataset appeared clean after this thorough check. The only modification was adding the currency symbol ($) to the gross income column for clarity.

Tool Used: Excel for analysis and visualization.

Key Insights and KPIs;

1. Total Sales: $322,967.
2. Best Performing Branch: Branch C.
3. Top Purchasing Line Across All Branches: Food and Beverages.
4. Most Popular Payment Method: E-Wallet.

Key Takeaways and Observations;

Branch Performance: The analysis showed total sales for three branches (A, B, and C). Branch C had the highest sales, followed by Branch A, and Branch B had the lowest sales. This trend was also reflected in the gross income for each branch, with Branch C leading.

City Sales Performance: The analysis also showed sales by city. Naypyitaw had the highest sales, followed by Yangon, and Mandalay had the lowest sales. This trend corresponds to the sales data at the branches, as Branch C (located in Naypyitaw) had the highest sales.

Gender and Purchase Behavior: There were noticeable differences in purchasing behavior by gender. Although females made most of the purchases, males also exhibited high product purchase activity. Additionally, when looking at purchasing power by gender across the branches, males seemed to have higher purchasing power in Branch A and Branch B. This suggests that while females may be the primary purchasers, males could be making higher-value or more frequent purchases in certain categories.

Product Line Sales Distribution: Food and Beverages was the top revenue-generating product line across all branches. Although the revenue differences between product lines were relatively small, the overall distribution of revenue across product lines remained well-balanced, suggesting that supermarkets maintain a diverse inventory with multiple high-performing categories.

Sales Trend Over Three Months: January recorded the highest sales, followed by February, which had the lowest sales, and March, which showed a recovery. The dip in February can be attributed to seasonal fluctuations that businesses often experience, while March sales rebounded, demonstrating more consistent sales across the months.

Recommendations;

Increase Product Availability in Low-Performing Branches: To improve sales across all branches, consider increasing the quantity of high-demand products in Branches A and B, particularly in categories that performed well in Branch C. This will help meet customer demand and prevent stockouts in popular categories.

Promote Low-Selling Products with Discounts: Consider advertising and offering discounts on products that generate lower sales in the different branches. Discount sales could help introduce customers to products they may not be familiar with, and this could help boost their sales. Special promotions or bundled discounts might be effective in driving interest.

Offer Promotions During Low-Sales Periods: February showed a notable dip in sales, so introducing promotional events, discounts, or exclusive offers during this month (or similar low-sales periods in the future) could help balance out seasonal fluctuations. These promotions can attract more customers during slower months, reducing the impact of seasonal dips on overall revenue.

Target Customer Preferences by Gender: Since purchasing behavior differs between genders, tailoring marketing strategies and promotional activities to appeal to both male and female customers could improve sales. For example, offering targeted discounts or specialized promotions based on the top-selling categories for each gender could boost overall sales.

Improve Payment Methods and Customer Convenience: With E-wallet being the most popular payment method, ensuring that this payment option remains seamless and easy to use will enhance the customer experience. Additionally, evaluating the effectiveness of Cash and Credit Card payments may provide further opportunities for optimizing the checkout process.
